# NYC Airbnb Data: An Unsupervised Learning Approach

This project explores hidden patterns in New York City Airbnb listings using unsupervised learning techniques. The aim is to uncover distinct groups of listings based on pricing, availability, and review behaviors without using any predefined labels.

We applied key methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), matrix completion, K-Means clustering, and hierarchical clustering to analyze and interpret real-world data from Inside Airbnb.

## Project Question

Can we uncover hidden groups of Airbnb listings that reveal different pricing strategies, availability patterns, and hosting behavior?

Identified patterns include:

•⁠  ⁠Budget friendly listings with high availability  
•⁠  ⁠Luxury or commercial listings with fewer reviews  
•⁠  ⁠High volume host listings with distinct review behavior

##  Techniques Applied

•⁠  ⁠PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization  
•⁠  ⁠Matrix completion with simulated missingness  
•⁠  ⁠K-Means clustering (using PCA-reduced features)  
•⁠  ⁠Hierarchical clustering (single, average, complete linkage)  
•⁠  ⁠Scree plots and dendrograms for interpretation
